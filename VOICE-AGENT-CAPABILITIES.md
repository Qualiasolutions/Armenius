# 🎙️ Maria's Enhanced Voice Capabilities with Vapi MCP + Firecrawl

## ✅ What Maria Can Now Do

### 🔥 **Live Product Data Access**

**BEFORE:** Maria could only check database inventory (potentially hours old)
**NOW:** Maria gets live, real-time data from armenius.com.cy during phone calls

#### Example Interactions:

**Customer:** "What RTX 4090 graphics cards do you have in stock?"

**Maria's NEW Response:**
> "Let me check our live website for the most current information... 
> *[Uses searchLiveProducts with Firecrawl MCP]*
> Based on our live website, we currently have 3 RTX 4090 models available:
> 1. NVIDIA RTX 4090 MSI Gaming X Trio - €1,699.99 (In Stock)
> 2. ASUS RTX 4090 TUF Gaming - €1,649.99 (In Stock) 
> 3. Gigabyte RTX 4090 AORUS Master - €1,799.99 (In Stock)
> Would you like more details about any of these models?"

---

**Customer (Greek):** "Ποια είναι η τρέχουσα τιμή για gaming laptops;"

**Maria's NEW Response:**
> "Θα ελέγξω την ιστοσελίδα μας για τις πιο πρόσφατες τιμές...
> *[Uses searchLiveProducts with Firecrawl MCP]*
> Με βάση την ζωντανή μας ιστοσελίδα, τα gaming laptop μας κυμαίνονται από €899 έως €2,499. 
> Έχουμε 8 διαφορετικά μοντέλα διαθέσιμα αυτή τη στιγμή. Θα θέλατε να ακούσετε για κάποια συγκεκριμένα;"

### ⚡ **Zapier Automation Integration**

**NEW Capability:** Maria can now trigger automated workflows

**Customer:** "Can you send me an email with those product details?"

**Maria's NEW Response:**
> "Absolutely! I'll send you an email confirmation with all the RTX 4090 details right now.
> *[Uses zapierTools to trigger email workflow]*
> Done! You should receive the email within a few minutes at your registered email address. 
> Is there anything else I can help you with?"

---

### 🧠 **Smart Fallback System**

**Scenario:** Live website temporarily unavailable

**Maria's NEW Behavior:**
> "I'm having trouble accessing our live website right now, but let me check our database...
> *[Automatically falls back to checkInventory]*
> The information might be a few hours old, but here's what I have: [database results]
> I'll also make sure to have our team verify the current stock when you visit the store."

## 🎯 **Usage Priority System**

Maria now follows this intelligent decision tree:

```
Customer asks about products
       ↓
1. Try searchLiveProducts (live armenius.com.cy data)
       ↓
   Success? → Use live results + mention "live website"
       ↓
   Failed? → Fall back to checkInventory (database)
       ↓
2. Customer needs follow-up? → Use zapierTools (email, SMS, etc.)
```

---

## 📊 **Data Source Transparency**

Maria now clearly indicates her data source:

- **Live Data:** "Based on our live website..." / "Με βάση την ζωντανή ιστοσελίδα μας..."
- **Database:** "From our current database..." / "Από τη βάση δεδομένων μας..."
- **Fallback:** "The information might be a few hours old, but..."

---

## 🔄 **Automated Daily Updates**

**Background Process:** Every day at 6 AM, the system automatically:
1. Scrapes armenius.com.cy for new products and price changes
2. Updates the database with fresh information
3. Ensures Maria has both live access AND up-to-date fallback data

---

## 🌍 **Bilingual Live Data**

Both Greek and English customers get the same live data experience:

- **Detection:** Automatic language detection from customer profile or speech
- **Responses:** Live product data formatted in customer's preferred language  
- **Fallbacks:** Error messages and fallbacks also in correct language

---

## 🚀 **Production Ready Features**

✅ **Cost Optimized:** Live data cached for 10 minutes to reduce API calls
✅ **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks ensure calls never fail
✅ **Performance:** Live searches typically complete in 2-3 seconds
✅ **Monitoring:** All live searches tracked for performance analysis
✅ **Reliability:** Automatic retry logic with intelligent fallbacks
